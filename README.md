### --------------------------------------------
### Little help with project setup under RStudio
### if project created in RStudio first, then connected to GitHub

### Sets the new remote
#### $ git remote add origin remote repository URL
### Verifies the new remote URL
#### $ git remote -v
### Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin 
#### $ git push origin master
### If that does not work, pull first
#### $ git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
### If Push/Pull buttons a greyed out in RStudio, try:
#### git push -u origin master
